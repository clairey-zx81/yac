You can then use the   playlistItems.list method to retrieve any of those lists. You can also add or remove items from those lists by calling the   playlistItems.insert and   playlistItems.delete methods. For example, if a user gives a positive rating to a video, you would insert that video into the liked videos playlist for that user's channel.",
